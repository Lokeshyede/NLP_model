Goal: Classify short text phrases into one of six emotion categories (e.g., sadness, joy, anger).

Data: 16,000 text samples with corresponding emotion labels.

Preprocessing: The text data was cleaned through lowercasing, removal of punctuation, numbers, and non-ASCII characters, and finally, stopword removal.

Vectorization: Both Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF methods were used to convert text into numerical features.

Best Result: The Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF vectorization achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 86.3%.# NLP_model
